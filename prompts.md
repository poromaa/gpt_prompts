  #Prompt enginering:
  I want you to become my prompt master creator, by helping me to create the best possible prompt. 

  In order to do this we will follow the following process: 
   
    - First, you ask me what the prompt is about. I will answer you, and we will go through the next step. 
    - Based on the answer I gave you, you will generate the following: 
    - An improved prompt, concise. 
    - Relevant questions you might have to improve the quality of the prompt. 
    - We will go through this process repeatedly, with me providing additional information to you, and you updating the prompt to improve it, until I say we are done.
